                    Ray Charles ("Brother Ray") was one of the very first pioneers of soul music. And like many of the
                    first
                    soul musicians he pulled heavily form gospel.

                <p>

                    One of Charle’s first hits after escaping poverty was I’ve got a woman, he originally claimed it to
                    be an original work, but later admitted it was a rearrangement of the gospel It must be jesus.

            <h1>Sam Cooke</h1>
            <p>
                Cooke was a performer deeply aware of and constantly managing his audience. He had been raised as a
                gospel singer in his Father’s church, and over the course of several US gospel tours, Cooke became the
                biggest name in Gospel. On his successful single, “You Send Me,” Cooke pulls away from the gospel
                community by performing with a quartet of White female singers rather than a gospel quartet.
            </p>
            <div style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row'}}>
                <p style={{flexBasis: '50%'}}>
                    Many of his performances were threatened by the KKK and Cooke received frequent death threats. This
                    backdrop of hate underlies so much of Cooke’s presentation as a performer. Being acceptable to White
                    America may not have been just a way for Cooke to achieve crossover success, but also a way to cope
                    with
                    a repressive society while building the fame he desired after eclipsing gospel.

            <p>Following the same pattern as Charles we also see Cooke adapting gospel in his earliest secular works.
                But, as a major gospel performer Cooke felt the need to hedge his bets by publishing Lovable under the
                <em> pseudonym</em> Dale Cook. His iconic voice was quickly recognized by many in the gospel
                community rushing his transition to secular music.

            <p>
                Early soul performers like Cooke were often attempting to be palatable to a white audience. This was
                more common in MoTown Soul the variety of soul native to Detroit with a significantly more pop bent.
                MoTown was the first label to commercialize soul music, a significant step just a few years after soul
                departed from gospel.
            </p>
            <p>
                MoTown, the record label, frequently utilized a small group of very talented in-house musicians to
                professionalize new soul sounds. This group of studio musicians, <em>The Funk Brothers </em>
                played on 100+ of MoTown hits.

                In the transition from gospel to MoTown style pop it became much more common
                for female MoTown singers to sing in much higher, less
                bluesier registers than would later become common in soul.
            </p>
            <p>MoTown's first breakout hit was Shop Around by the Miracles</p>

            <p>
                Chicago soul was jazzier, bluesier, and lighter than MoTown blues. While still being very popular,
                Chicago soul departed from what white audiences were expecting far more than MoTown. Chicago soul
                produced some of the first civil rights oriented soul music as well as non-political popular music.
            </p>
            <p>
                Side by side we have: the popular "Oh, What a Night - The Dell’s" and the political "People Get Ready -
                The Impressions
                " - The Impressions. While political soul music often contained specific critique of oppressive systems
                it rarely did do so by departing from the smooth sound that characterizes much of the genre.

            <h1>Two Categories of Modern Soul</h1>
            <h2>Contemporary R&B & Classic Soul</h2>
            <p>Modern soul is divided into two fairly stark categories: soul music that sounds a great deal like it did
                in the 1950s and significantly more modern soul music. Exemplifying the former camp are Charles Bradley
                Leon Bridges, “who dresses exclusively in vintage clothing and sings like Sam Cooke”. An intentional
                appeal to classic soul. Bradley on the other hand draws his comparison to soul with his own extensive
                life experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the modern camp are artists like Erykah Badu. Badu’s music is far more political than Bradley &
                Bridges. Specifically New Amerykah opines many of the same issues we saw classic soul chronicling in a
                far more modern style.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Badu first emerged in the late 90s as part of the “neo-soul” scene, along with D’Angelo, Musiq Soulchild, Jill Scott and India.Arie, who collectively rethought and revived the spirit of early 70s"
